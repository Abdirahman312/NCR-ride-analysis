# 🚖 NCR Ride Bookings Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes ride booking data from NCR to uncover key insights such as ride patterns, popular routes, booking status trends, and customer/driver ratings.  
It was completed as part of my data analysis portfolio using **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)** in Jupyter Notebook.
